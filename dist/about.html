        <p>Hey there! I'm Andrew and I'm a DC-based software engineer, currently at Upside Business Travel. I have a
            Bachelors in Computer Engineering from University of Maryland, College Park.</p>
        <p>My background has primarily been building for the web, but I've had the fortune to dabble in networking,
            security, operating systems, embedded devices, AI, Computer Vision, design - the list goes on and on. I love
            technology and I love learning - if there's something I don't know, I'll happily go down a deep Google
            rabbit hole to learn more.</p>
        <p>I believe heavily in the people aspect of technology - from communicating ideas clearly on the whiteboard
            amongst team members to listening and adapting to the customer's needs and demands to produce quality, well
            functioning software to deliver to the end user. </p>
        <p>I've been fortunate to work with extremely talented mentors and peers who have taught me so much and I'm
            always looking to pay it forward by helping others wherever I can. I enjoy teaching and mentoring, having taught
            others in everything from writing their first line of code to throwing their first punch.</p>
        <p> My goal is to combine my love for tech with my love for helping others - by applying technology to solve
            problems that plague our world. I'm driven by a desire to solve problems that matter and to leave a place
            better than I found it. I'm always on the lookout for a new challenge.</p>
