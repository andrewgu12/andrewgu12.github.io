<p>Hey there! My name's Andrew Gu, or if you prefer my legal name (as many of my friends do), Mingbo Gu. </p>
<p>I'm currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park studying Computer Engineering and expected to graduate in May of 2018. I'm also an incoming software engineer for IBM. </p>
<p>I've been fascinated by computers and technology since I was a little kid. I began programming in high school and since then, I've been fortunate enough to work on a variety of applications for companies and research labs of varying sizes. I've worked on building full scale web and mobile apps for startups and huge corporations to a controls system for our university's linear accelerator (shattering every misconception I had about nuclear reactors). </p>
<p>
  I love learning about and working with anything technology related. My interests include machine learning, systems programming, web development,
  security, embedded devices, the crossroad between Physics and computer science, and whatever else I come across. I often find myself going down very deep rabbit holes, going from link to link as I learn more about something I don't know.
</p>

  When I'm not coding or trying to complete the endless amounts of homework, you can usually find me cooking (great excuse to procrastinate), drinking unhealthy amounts of bubble tea,
  binge watching Youtube videos (gotta love that Wong Fu and JK Films), or just simply hanging out with friends. I'm also an avid martial artist - I received my 1st degree black belt
  in Shotokan Karate from Jim Mather at the California Karate Academy.
