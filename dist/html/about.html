<p>	Hey there! My name's Andrew Gu, or if you prefer my legal name (as many of my friends do), Mingbo Gu. At one point in time, I had a fancy parallax website with a lot of pretty colors, but unfortunately I haven't had the time to keep up with it. I opted to go for the more minimalistic simple approach - it was less time consuming to build and would be easier to update in the future.</p>
<p>I'm currently a student at the University of Maryland, College Park studying Computer Engineering with a minor in Physics and expected to graduate in May 2018. I'm also currently at <a href="http://www.fiscalnote.com">FiscalNote</a> , working as a junior front end engineer.</p>
<p>I've been fascinated by computers and technology since I was a little kid. I began seriously programming as a freshmen in high school, and since then I've been graciously given opportunities to work in numerous companies and to learn from and work with many talented individuals. Most of my work has been primarily web based (for MyWebRoom, Fusion Ventures, AppCow, and FiscalNote), ranging from building beautiful interfaces using MVC frameworks to building custom CMS's and secure login and payment systems in Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and PHP. </p>
<p>I love learning about and working with anything technology related. My current interests include databases and data mining, systems programming (currently teaching myself Rust!), security, and the crossroad between Physics and computer science.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding or slaving over homework, you can usually find me cooking (lots of variations of fried rice), drinking unhealthy amounts of bubble tea, binge watching Youtube videos (gotta love that Wong Fu and JK Films), or just simply hanging out with friends. I'm also an avid martial artist - I received my 1st degree black belt in Shotokan Karate from Jim Mather at the California Karate Academy. </p>
